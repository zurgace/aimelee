# melee-pc

> **AI-Melee.** This fork adds an agent bridge for playing offline against the
> [Phillip](https://github.com/vladfi1/phillip) AI. Install and play on
> [Linux](#ai-melee-play-against-phillip) or [Windows 10/11](#windows-10).

**Beta, for testing only.** "melee-pc" is a working name. Online play with
rollback netcode is in development. This branch includes LAN, internet friend
codes, Unranked matchmaking and ranked best-of-three sets. See
[Netplay](#netplay-lan-and-direct-ip-prototype) for setup and verification limits.

A native PC port of Super Smash Bros. Melee (NTSC-U 1.02), built from
[doldecomp/melee](https://github.com/doldecomp/melee) on top of
[aurora](https://github.com/encounter/aurora) (GX/OS/PAD/DVD/CARD/THP
compatibility layer with a WebGPU backend) and SDL3. Same approach as
[dusklight](https://github.com/TwilitRealm/dusklight).

You need your own disc image. **No game data ships here.** The decompiled game
code is not licensed and is not relicensed by this project; only the port code
is GPL-3.0-or-later. Details under [License](#license).

## Status

Every mode boots and plays: VS, 1-P Classic / Adventure / All-Star to
completion with results and score saved, Training, Stadium (Target Test,
Home-Run Contest, 10-Man Melee), Event Match, Trophy gallery, memory card
create / load, opening movie and attract demos.

**This table is the single source of truth for feature status.** The release
notes, the project site and `ROADMAP.md` defer to it; when they disagree, this
table is right and the other one is stale.

| Feature | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Linux x86-64 / aarch64 | done | AppImage and tarball, both built in CI. |
| Windows x86-64 / ARM64 | done | D3D12 or Vulkan; ARM64 via llvm-mingw. |
| Direct3D 11 backend (Windows) | partial | Compiled into the shipped Dawn for both architectures, ordered after D3D12 and selectable as `MELEE_BACKEND=d3d11`. The adapter enumerates and the fail-over to D3D12 is proven, but no working D3D11 device has been observed; Wine/Proton cannot create one (`CreateDeviceContextState` returns `E_INVALIDARG`), so it is unverified on real Windows and on the Intel Gen7 hardware it exists for. |
| Android arm64 | done | Drawn on-screen GameCube overlay with opacity, deadzone and haptics settings; hides itself when a physical gamepad is connected. |
| iOS arm64 | partial | Sideloadable IPA on Metal, cross-built from Linux. Touch input is fixed invisible screen regions (stick on the left half, face buttons bottom right) with no drawn overlay, no calibration and no gamepad auto-hide -- the Android overlay is Android-only. |
| macOS Apple Silicon / Intel | partial | Apple Silicon tested; the Intel job is `continue-on-error` in CI, so a release can ship without an Intel build and none has been run on Intel hardware. |
| Browser (WebGPU) | partial | [Play in the browser](https://999sian.github.io/melee-pc/play/) with your own raw GALE01 rev 2 image; tested in Chrome. No online play, no gamepad remapping. Build: `tools/browser/build.py`. |
| PAL disc (GALP01) | partial | Experimental: USA game code on PAL data, English (UK) text, NTSC 60 Hz. Trophy tables are stubbed out rather than read, and there is no reference hash, so PAL images always verify as unknown. |
| Widescreen 16:9 / window aspect | partial | VS, Sudden Death and Training only; menus, results and cutscenes stay at the original 73:60. |
| Wide HUD anchoring | done | Separate on/off toggle from the aspect setting, and only moves anything while widescreen is on. Anchors the timer and the 2-4 player HUD groups (damage, stocks, tags); a 1-player HUD keeps its original placement. No configurable margins. |
| Custom texture packs (Dolphin format) | done | `tex1_*` `.dds` / `.png` including sidecar mips and TLUT hashes, scanned recursively, reloadable from the F1 menu. |
| Custom soundtrack (`.ogg` / `.wav`) | done | Replaces any track the game streams, not just stage BGM. Files are decoded whole into RAM (not streamed) and loop end to end, so a track's own loop point is ignored. |
| Unlock Everything / Frozen Stadium / Free camera | done | Cheats tab in the launcher and the F1 menu. |
| Multi-bus audio (Master / Music / SFX) | done | Three sliders; Master is the output stream gain, Music and SFX are per-voice. |
| In-app update check | done | Polls GitHub releases, downloads with progress. |
| Controller rumble | done | SDL gamepads through the game's own `PADControlMotor` calls, and the Android device vibrator when the pad has no rumble. Controller LED / port-colour sync is not implemented. |
| 1000 Hz GameCube adapter (WUP-028) | partial | Implemented and wired, not yet confirmed against a physical adapter. Raw 0x21 reports are read through SDL's hidapi on the 1000 Hz input thread, so the game would see the controller's real 8-bit values instead of SDL's rescaled ones; adapter slot N is PAD port N, and the slot motors are driven from the game's rumble state. `MELEE_GC_ADAPTER=0` hands the device back to SDL's driver. Linux needs a udev rule; the log prints it. |
| UCF (dashback, shield drop) | done | UCF 0.8x rules; launcher Gameplay page / F1 port menu, default off, `MELEE_UCF=1`. Reads the octagon-clamped stick rather than UCF's pre-clamp raw queue, which only differs past the 80-unit rim. |
| Discord Rich Presence | planned | Deferred until API credentials are available. |
| Extended hazardless stages | planned | Whispy, Randall, FoD platforms. Only Pokémon Stadium is implemented. |
| 2-player keyboard remapping | planned | The keyboard is port 1 on a fixed layout. |
| High-refresh interpolation | planned | |
| Training tools (hitboxes, savestates, frame advance) | planned | |
| Replay recording (`.slp`) | done | Set `MELEE_SLP_DIR` to record offline or online VS matches; off by default. |
| Online play (LAN / direct IP) | partial | LAN/direct-IP plus signed internet Direct, Unranked and Ranked implemented. Every datagram is authenticated (protocol 9), so both peers must run the same build, and a connect code is 8 characters after the `#`. Phone VPN to home broadband Direct Connect reached results; broader two-NAT and live ranked acceptance remain pending. See platform matrix below. |
| RetroAchievements | planned | |

The phases behind the planned rows, and why they are ordered that way, are in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Download

Builds for every platform are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/999sian/melee-pc/releases). Release notes
list the per-platform files, known issues and requirements.

```sh
./Melee-x86_64.AppImage                  # open the launcher
./Melee-x86_64.AppImage /path/to/melee.iso
```

**Melee USA revision 2 (NTSC-U 1.02, GALE01)** is the supported disc. A
**Europe (PAL, GALP01)** image also boots, with the limits listed in the
[status table](#status) and the mechanics in
[porting-notes.md](docs/porting-notes.md#regions). `.iso`,
`.gcm`, `.ciso` and `.rvz` images are accepted. A valid disc path on the
command line boots straight in; a missing or invalid one returns to the
launcher. Settings and the selected path live in `launcher.cfg` in SDL's
`melee-pc` preference directory (usually `~/.local/share/melee-pc`,
`%APPDATA%\melee-pc` on Windows, or `~/Library/Application Support/melee-pc`
on macOS).

Verification reads the disc through nod, compressed images included, and compares
SHA-1 against the
[Redump DAT](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/blob/master/metadat/redump/Nintendo%20-%20GameCube.dat):
`d4e70c064cc714ba8400a849cf299dbd1aa326fc`, 1,459,978,240 bytes. It supports
progress and cancellation, and is not cached between launches. Unverified images
still play; PAL images have no reference hash and always report as unverified.

Building from source: [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

## Requirements

The renderer is WebGPU (Dawn) at its compatibility level, so the floor is
Dawn's per-backend floor:

| Platform | API tried, in order | Floor |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 (x86-64, ARM64) | Direct3D 12 → Direct3D 11 → Vulkan | Feature level 11_0. Dawn refuses D3D12 on Intel Gen7 (HD 4000/4400/4600, Ivy Bridge/Haswell); the intended fallback for those is Direct3D 11, which is untested on that hardware (see the status table). Vulkan 1.1 with a vendor ICD. |
| Linux (x86-64, aarch64) | Vulkan | Vulkan 1.1 (Mesa radv/anv/hasvk, NVIDIA proprietary or NVK). |
| macOS / iOS | Metal | Any Metal GPU; Apple Silicon tested, iOS 14+. |
| Android | Vulkan | Vulkan 1.1, arm64. |

On Windows that means any Intel Gen8 (Broadwell, 2014) or newer, AMD GCN or
newer, NVIDIA Fermi or newer runs on Direct3D 12. Direct3D 11 is a
compatibility path, not a performance one (FXC shaders, no DXC). OpenGL is
never picked automatically: `MELEE_BACKEND=opengl` exists, but Dawn needs
desktop GL 4.4 for it, it draws with wrong (washed-out) colours on X11 and
cannot create a surface on Wayland. The log records every backend that was
skipped and why, then one summary line with the adapter and driver.

The CPU side is light: any x86-64 (SSE2) or arm64 CPU. A VS match holds a
steady 60 fps with the whole game pinned to two 2.5 GHz Meteor Lake
low-power E-cores, using about a third of one core in total.

- Keep `resources/` (and on Windows the DLLs: `webgpu_dawn.dll`,
  `dxcompiler.dll`, `dxil.dll`, `SDL3.dll`, the VC++ runtime) beside the
  executable. `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll` are the D3D12 shader compiler;
  D3D11 needs no extra DLL, since `d3d11.dll`, `dxgi.dll` and the FXC
  compiler are Windows components.
- Settings, memory cards, `music/` and `textures/` live in the `melee-pc`
  preference directory above.

## Controls

Keyboard: arrows or WASD = stick, IJKL = C-stick, X = A, Z = B, C = X, V = Y,
Q/E = L/R, Tab = Z, Enter = Start, TFGH = D-pad. Gamepads work through SDL; an
official GameCube adapter is read directly instead (see the status table).

| | Keyboard | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Navigate | Up/Down, Tab | D-pad or left stick |
| Adjust | Left/Right | D-pad left/right |
| Change tab | Left/Right on the tab strip | L/R shoulders |
| Select | Enter | A |
| Close overlay | Escape, F1 | B, Start, Back |

## Settings overlay

**F1**, or Back/Select on a gamepad, opens the overlay. The game pauses while it
is open.

- Display: fullscreen/windowed and VSync apply immediately. `MELEE_VSYNC`
  overrides the saved preference.
- Internal resolution and UI scale are sliders. UI scale covers 75% to 150%.
- Post-processing picks the presentation shader and applies immediately.
- Anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering apply on the next launch. MSAA offers
  only off and 4x because WebGPU guarantees sample counts 1 and 4.
- Audio: master volume, mute, FPS counter, all immediate.
- Controls remaps a gamepad. Pick the port, select a GameCube button, then press
  the physical button. Escape cancels, Restore resets the port. Back cannot be
  bound since it opens the menu. Sticks and triggers remap the same way, and a
  direction accepts either a stick axis or a button.

Melee's own menu sounds play in the overlay. Bindings are stored in aurora's
per-device `.controller` files; everything else shares `launcher.cfg`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MELEE_BACKEND=<name>` | Pin the graphics backend (`vulkan`, `d3d12`, `d3d11`, `metal`, ...) instead of the platform's preferred order; an unknown name lists the valid ones. |
| `MELEE_VSYNC=0\|1` | Override the saved VSync preference. |
| `MELEE_LOG_FILE=<path>` | Write the log to a file (default `melee-pc.log` beside `melee.exe` on Windows; empty disables). |
| `MELEE_WINDOW_TITLE=<t>` | Window title. |
| `MELEE_FILES_DIR=<dir>` | Loose-file overlay: files here (or in `./files/`) replace the disc's. |
| `MELEE_CACHE_MAX_MB=<n>` | In-memory archive cache budget (default picked from installed RAM). |
| `MELEE_PREWARM=0` | Skip the background asset pre-warm after boot. |
| `MELEE_FAST_FADES=1` | Clamp scene fade delays. |
| `MELEE_PIPELINE_JOBS=<n>` | Background shader-pipeline compile threads (default half the hardware threads, 1..8). |
| `MELEE_UCF=1` | Universal Controller Fix (UCF 0.8x dashback and shield-drop rules); overrides the `ucf` launcher.cfg pref. |
| `MELEE_GC_ADAPTER=0` | Hand the GameCube adapter (WUP-028) back to SDL's gamepad driver instead of reading it raw. |
| `MELEE_SLP_DIR=<dir>` | Record every VS match, offline or netplay, as a Slippi replay `<dir>/Game_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.slp` (replay format 3.18.0) that Slippi Launcher, slippi-js stats, Clippi and overlays read. Only frames no rollback can change are written, so both netplay peers' files hold the same frames. Off by default. |
| `MELEE_AGENT_SOCKET=<path>` or `tcp:127.0.0.1:<port>` | Agent bridge: listen on this AF_UNIX socket (or TCP port on the loopback interface only; Windows accepts only the TCP form) so an external agent (e.g. [Phillip](#ai-melee-play-against-phillip)) can watch the game and drive one port. Off by default; unset, nothing changes. |
| `MELEE_AGENT_PORT=<1-4>` | The port the agent drives (default 2). |
| `MELEE_AGENT_SYNC=lockstep\|async` | `lockstep` (default) waits up to the timeout for each tick's input; `async` never waits. |
| `MELEE_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` | Lockstep wait per tick (default 4). |
| `--no-card` | Boot without a memory card. |
| `--dvd <image>` | Explicit form of the positional disc argument. |
| `--version` | Print the build version and exit. |

Diagnostic knobs (`MELEE_DEBUG`, `MELEE_FPS`, `MELEE_HEAP_CHECK`, the
`AURORA_*` draw filters, ...) are listed in
[docs/debugging.md](docs/debugging.md#diagnostic-environment-variables).

## AI-Melee: play against Phillip

AI-Melee is this fork of melee-pc. It adds an agent bridge so you can play an
offline match against [Phillip](https://github.com/vladfi1/phillip), the
deep-RL Melee agent.

- **Inference only.** Phillip's trained networks run in numpy, and the game talks to them over a local socket (a Unix socket on Linux, loopback TCP on Windows) instead of a patched Dolphin.
- **Off by default.** The bridge is off unless `MELEE_AGENT_SOCKET` is set. It lives in `src/pc/agent_*` and hooks the existing per-tick `pc_net_sync` / `pc_slp_tick_end` calls, so no game code changes.

**On Windows?** Skip to [Windows 10](#windows-10): a download, no build.

**Assumptions.** The Linux instructions assume:
- **Linux.** Written for CachyOS/Arch, so package names are pacman's.
- **The [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell (3.1 or newer), run in a terminal such as [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/).** Every command below is fish syntax; the two places where bash differs are noted.
- **Your own disc.** A Melee NTSC-U 1.02 (GALE01) image.

### Install

1. **System packages** (once). Also install your GPU's Vulkan driver: `nvidia-utils` (NVIDIA), `vulkan-radeon` (AMD) or `vulkan-intel`. Most of these are already on a desktop install; `--needed` skips them.

   ```fish
   sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git cmake ninja python python-numpy uv \
       vulkan-icd-loader openssl curl libx11 libxext libxrandr libxcursor libxi \
       libxfixes libxss libxkbcommon libxtst wayland wayland-protocols libdecor \
       alsa-lib libpulse dbus systemd-libs
   ```

2. **AI-Melee and Phillip, side by side.** `play.py` looks for Phillip in `../phillip`.

   ```fish
   mkdir -p ~/src; and cd ~/src
   git clone -b claude/eager-planck-jptjp9 https://github.com/zurgace/aimelee.git ai-melee
   git clone https://github.com/vladfi1/phillip.git
   ```

   Already have a melee-pc clone? Add AI-Melee as a remote instead:
   `git remote add aimelee https://github.com/zurgace/aimelee.git; and git fetch aimelee; and git switch -c ai-melee aimelee/claude/eager-planck-jptjp9`

3. **Build.** The first configure downloads Dawn and a few libraries.

   ```fish
   cd ~/src/ai-melee
   cmake -B build -G Ninja; and ninja -C build
   ```

4. **Point it at your disc.** A universal variable is remembered by every fish session, and every AI-Melee tool reads `MELEE_DISC`, so you can drop `--iso`. In bash, put `export MELEE_DISC=...` in `~/.bashrc` instead.

   ```fish
   set -Ux MELEE_DISC ~/Games/Melee/GALE01.iso
   ```

5. **Export the agent** (once per agent). This runs Phillip's checkpoint through TensorFlow 2.13 in a throwaway Python 3.11 environment managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); it downloads about 200 MB the first time. After that, playing needs only numpy. `play.py` does this step by itself on the first run if you skip it.

   ```fish
   uv run --python 3.11 --with 'tensorflow-cpu==2.13.*' --with attrs \
       tools/agent/export_weights.py --phillip ../phillip --agent FalconFalconBF
   ```

   Keep the quotes around `tensorflow-cpu==2.13.*`. fish treats an unquoted `*` as a file glob and stops with "No matches for wildcard".

6. **Optional: an `ai-melee` command.** Afterwards, `ai-melee`, `ai-melee --quick` or `ai-melee --agent delay0/FoxFD` work from any directory.

   ```fish
   function ai-melee --description 'Play Melee against Phillip (AI-Melee)'
       python3 ~/src/ai-melee/tools/agent/play.py $argv
   end
   funcsave ai-melee
   ```

### Play

```fish
ai-melee          # or, from ~/src/ai-melee: python3 tools/agent/play.py
```

The game opens its own window, and the terminal keeps the agent's log: match start, matchup warnings, and latency and late-input counts when a match ends. Click the game window before you play: the keyboard only reaches the game while its window has focus.

- **Set up the match.** The default agent, `FalconFalconBF`, plays Captain Falcon on P2 and was trained on Falcon vs Falcon on Battlefield.
  - Take P1 (keyboard, or a gamepad on port 1) and pick Captain Falcon.
  - P2 reads as plugged in. With P1's cursor, click P2's door to CPU, pick Captain Falcon for it, then click the door on to HMN.
  - Choose Battlefield.
- **During the match.** The agent drives P2 from GO! and lets go when the match ends. Close the game window, or press Ctrl-C in the terminal, to stop both.
- **Quick start.** `--quick` skips the menus and boots straight into the agent's matchup.
- **Other agents.** `--agent <name>` picks another agent. `tools/agent/list_agents.py` lists every agent's character, stage and delay. The agent warns when the match you set up differs from its training matchup.
- **Other options.** `--port`, `--delay`, `--epsilon`, `--sync`, `--timeout-ms`, `--frame-lag` and `--record` are described in `play.py --help`.
- **Running the pieces by hand.** fish accepts one-off variables in front of a command, as bash does:
  - `MELEE_AGENT_SOCKET=/tmp/melee-agent.sock build/melee $MELEE_DISC` starts the game with the bridge on.
  - `python3 tools/agent/agent.py --weights tools/agent/weights/FalconFalconBF.npz` then plays P2, and `python3 tools/agent/dump_state.py` prints what the bridge exports. Run only one of the two: the bridge serves one client at a time.
- **Performance.**
  - A network step takes about 0.15 ms (p99 0.3 ms) of the 16.7 ms tick.
  - The state leaves the game right after the tick's logic, and the input is only needed after rendering, so a healthy agent never makes the game wait.
  - A slow or dead agent costs at most the timeout per tick. After 30 misses in a row the game stops waiting, and a killed agent leaves P2 on a neutral pad.
- **More detail.** [tools/agent/NOTES.md](tools/agent/NOTES.md) has the field mapping, verification results, known gaps and the checks to run (`check_phase1.py`, `check_phase2.py`, `check_phase3.py`, `check_vanilla.py`). `inject_script.py` drives the agent port without any AI.

### Windows 10

For Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit, starting from nothing but your disc image. You download a ready-made build and nothing is compiled. Everything below is typed in PowerShell or done by clicking.

**What you need.**
- **Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit,** with an up-to-date graphics driver (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel). The game draws with Direct3D 12; see [Requirements](#requirements).
- **Your Melee disc image:** NTSC-U 1.02 (GALE01), usually a `.iso` file.
- **About 2 GB of free disk space and an internet connection** for the first run. Later runs work offline.

**What gets installed.**
- **Python 3.12**, which runs the AI.
- **Two Python packages:**
  - `numpy` runs Phillip's network.
  - `uv` converts Phillip's saved network once, using a temporary copy of Python 3.11 and TensorFlow 2.13 that it downloads and manages itself.
- **The AI-Melee download** (the game plus the AI scripts) and **Phillip's source**, which holds the trained agents.

1. **Install Python 3.12.** Download the "Windows installer (64-bit)" from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). In the installer's first screen tick **Add python.exe to PATH**, then click **Install Now**. Alternatively, in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   winget install Python.Python.3.12
   ```

2. **Install the Python packages.** Open PowerShell (Start menu, type `powershell`, Enter) and run:

   ```powershell
   py -m pip install numpy uv
   ```

   pip may warn that a Scripts folder "is not on PATH". You can ignore that: AI-Melee finds uv either way.

3. **Download AI-Melee.**
   - Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/zurgace/aimelee/releases) and download `AI-Melee-Windows-x86_64.zip` from the newest release.
   - Right-click the zip, choose **Extract All...**, and extract it to a folder you own, for example `C:\Games`.
   - You get a folder `AI-Melee` containing `melee.exe`, `Play AI-Melee.bat` and an `ai-melee` folder. Don't put it under `C:\Program Files`: the AI saves files next to itself.

4. **Download Phillip.**
   - On [github.com/vladfi1/phillip](https://github.com/vladfi1/phillip), click the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**.
   - Extract that zip into the `AI-Melee` folder, so it contains a `phillip-master` folder. `phillip-master\phillip-master` from Extract All is fine too.

5. **Play.** Double-click `Play AI-Melee.bat` in the `AI-Melee` folder.
   - **First run only:** a window asks for your disc image (it may open behind the console), and the choice is remembered.
   - **Then a one-time conversion:** it downloads TensorFlow once (about 250 MB) and converts Phillip's network. This takes a few minutes; later starts take seconds.
   - **Then the game opens.** The console window stays open with the AI's log.

6. **In the game.**
   - Click the game window so it gets the keyboard.
   - Set up the match as in [Play](#play): you are P1 on Captain Falcon; switch P2 to CPU, pick Captain Falcon, switch back to HMN; choose Battlefield.
   - Close the game window to stop.

**Options.** `Play AI-Melee.bat` passes its arguments to `play.py`. In PowerShell, from the `AI-Melee` folder:

```powershell
& '.\Play AI-Melee.bat' --quick                # skip the menus
& '.\Play AI-Melee.bat' --agent delay0/FoxFD   # another agent
py ai-melee\play.py --help                     # every option
py ai-melee\list_agents.py --phillip phillip-master   # the agents and their matchups
```

**Troubleshooting.**
- **"Windows protected your PC"** (SmartScreen) when starting `melee.exe`: the build is not code-signed. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
- **"Python was not found"** or **`py` is not recognized**: re-run the Python installer, choose **Modify**, and make sure **py launcher** and **Add Python to environment variables** are ticked.
- **"the agent needs numpy"** or **"that needs uv"**: run step 2 again.
- **"cannot find Phillip's agent"**: the message lists where it looked. Check that `phillip-master\agents` exists inside `AI-Melee`, or pass `--phillip <folder>`.
- **A Windows Firewall prompt for melee.exe**: the AI connection only listens on 127.0.0.1 (this computer only), which the firewall doesn't block, so either answer works for AI-Melee. Netplay needs it allowed.
- **The game doesn't start or shows a black window**: update your graphics driver, then double-click `RUN-AND-LOG.bat` and read `melee-pc.log`. The [project site](https://999sian.github.io/melee-pc/) FAQ covers first-run problems.
- **Wrong disc remembered**: delete `ai-melee\settings.json`, or pass `--iso <path>`.

The Windows build is made by this fork's [release workflow](.github/workflows/ai-melee-windows.yml) and has not yet been played on a real Windows machine. The bridge's Windows networking is tested under Wine. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/zurgace/aimelee/issues) with the console output if something goes wrong.

## Netplay (LAN and direct IP, prototype)

Two copies of the game play a rollback match over UDP (`src/pc/net.c`;
design and current state in [docs/netcode-plan.md](docs/netcode-plan.md)).
Both must run the same build **and the same game image**, with no memory card
(`--no-card`). The LAN lobby announces a 32-bit id of the disc it booted
(region, revision, file-table shape and the DOL, so a code mod counts), and a
peer on a different image is listed as incompatible before a single game
packet is exchanged — same as a different build version. Internet friend-code
pairing also binds build and disc identity; the legacy direct-IP environment
path retains its older protocol-version-only check.

In the menus: VS Mode → ONLINE → LAN PLAY finds other
copies on the local network by mDNS and the first Start elects a host
(lowest install id wins a tie). DIRECT CONNECT opens an in-game hub where
either player can call a friend's `NAME#XXXXXXXX` code, enter its eight-character
suffix, or choose a clipboard code or recent opponent. UNRANKED searches for
an opponent; RANKED runs a rated best-of-three set. PROFILE shows your code
and locally verified rating. Internet discovery may take about 30 seconds to
bootstrap and some NATs cannot support a direct peer connection. Legacy
`MELEE_LAN_DIRECT=ip:port` remains available for direct-IP sessions. The game port is UDP 41000 by default and discovery uses UDP
5353 multicast; allow both through the firewall (Windows asks on first
launch). The install id used for the election is `install_id` in
`launcher.cfg`.

If the link drops mid-match, the session no longer dies with it: after 7 s of
silence it enters a reconnect phase and resumes where it left off if the peer
comes back within 15 s and neither side's 64-frame input ring has been
outrun. The lobby shows "reconnecting"; a failure that cannot be resumed says
"Could not resume" instead of "Connection timed out".

A peer that is *loading* is not a peer that is gone. Silence is measured from
the last datagram the peer sent, not from how long this side has been
waiting: a machine whose game thread is inside a stage load, a character
load or a first-time shader compile keeps its sender running, so the link
carries it however long it takes and the transition screen simply waits.
Before that distinction existed, any load over 7 s froze both games on "NOW
LOADING" and one over ~22 s ended the session outright, which is what a
phone's first match cost.

**What works where.** Only Linux x86-64 has played real matches, but a Linux
recording now replays bit-identical on Windows, so the two builds compute the
same game.

| Platform | Netplay | Rollback | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux x86-64 | yes | yes | the configuration everything below was measured on; longest run 36 minutes and 126k frames of match |
| Windows x86-64 / ARM64 | implemented | enabled | PE ranges cover both supported toolchains. x86-64 restore runs under Wine; ARM64 compiler-bridge and linked-range checks pass. Full Windows rollback gameplay remains unverified |
| macOS / iOS | builds; online gameplay unverified | enabled | Mach-O simulation sections support Intel/Apple Silicon macOS and ARM64 iOS. Cross-link/bridge checks pass; native restore is a macOS CI check. Device gameplay remains unverified |
| Android | runs on a device; found and joined a PC over LAN | enabled; gameplay unverified | Measured on a Pixel 8 Pro against Linux x86-64: mDNS discovery, election, handshake and 1800+ frames of synced menus at 10-16 ms ping and 0 % loss, both peers entering the CSS on the same frame. Full matches have since been played to the end phone-to-PC over LAN and over mobile data. New ARM64/x86-64 NDK-linked restore fixtures pass (ARM64 under QEMU), but device rollback gameplay is still unproven. The lobby holds the Wi-Fi multicast lock while it is open |

All supported builds require simulation snapshot sections and verify their
boundaries after linking. Audio/worker state remains excluded. Menus and scene
loading still synchronize without prediction; matches use rollback by default.
Allocation failure and the explicit debugging switch can still fall back to
lockstep. Unsupported compilers are rejected rather than producing a silently
lockstep-only platform build.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MELEE_NET=<host:port>` | Connect to that peer at boot, no lobby (`MELEE_NET_PLAYER` on both sides). The session runs the same RULES/READY handshake a lobby one does, hosted by `MELEE_NET_PLAYER=0`, so the seed, rules and unlock state are agreed rather than assumed and a disagreement refuses the session instead of desyncing later. `MELEE_SEED` is optional, and only the host's is used. |
| `MELEE_NET_PORT=<n>` | Local UDP game port (default 41000). Two copies on one machine need different ports. |
| `MELEE_NET_PLAYER=0\|1` | Controller port the local player drives with `MELEE_NET`: 0 = P1/host, 1 = P2. |
| `MELEE_NET_DELAY=<n>\|auto` | Input delay in frames (default `auto`: 1–4 from ping and jitter, at least 2 in a fight (1 on a LAN under 10 ms ping and 2 ms jitter), re-evaluated every 600 frames, changed only between matches). |
| `MELEE_NET_RECONNECT_MS=<ms>` | How long a broken link may take to resume (default 15000). `0` disables the reconnect phase: the session drops 7 s after the peer goes quiet, as it used to. Anything negative or unparseable falls back to the default. |
| `MELEE_LAN_TEST=1\|host` | LAN lobby without the menu; `host` presses Start once the title is up. Both set to `host` exercises a simultaneous Start. |
| `MELEE_LAN_DIRECT=<ip:port>` | Direct connect without the menu, at frame 300; set on both sides with the other's address. The lower `ip:port` hosts. |
| `MELEE_NET_STALL_TEST=<frame>[:<ms>]` | Park the guest's game thread for `ms` at that frame (default 10000), standing in for a load the netcode cannot shorten. The sender keeps running, so this is the "peer is loading, not gone" case; only player 1 does it, so one exported value stalls exactly one side. |
| `MELEE_NET_RECORD=<file>` | Write the seed, then per frame the four pad states simulated and a state checksum. |
| `MELEE_NET_REPLAY=<file>` | Feed a recording back in; reports the first frame whose checksum differs (`net: REPLAY DIVERGED`). Solo only. |
| `MELEE_NET_STATE_LOG=<file>` | Write two lines per frame to that file: the readable state line, and the raw float bits of exactly the fields the checksum covers. Only meaningful with `MELEE_NET_RECORD`/`MELEE_NET_REPLAY`; this is how two platforms' runs are diffed down to the field that differs. |
| `MELEE_INPUT_TRACE=1` | One `pad: ` line per change of port 0's virtual pad, with the focus and fifo state that produced it. |
| `MELEE_NET_SYNCTEST=1` | Run every tick twice from a restored snapshot and compare state hashes; sound is off. Proves the snapshot covers everything a tick reads. |
| `MELEE_NET_ROLLBACK=off` | Play the session in lockstep — no prediction, no snapshots. A bisecting tool, not a mode. |
| `MELEE_NET_SYNC=off\|legacy` | Measure the clock offset but never act on it, or restore the pre-batch skip behaviour. |
| `MELEE_NET_PAD_QTYPE=0` | Restore the raw pad queue's shifting overflow branch; the regression test for the input-slip fix. |
| `MELEE_NET_AUDIO_JOURNAL=off`, `MELEE_NET_AUDIO_DEAF=off` | Restore the two audio behaviours netplay overrides for determinism; each is the regression test for its own defect. |
| `MELEE_NET_RESIM_AUDIT=<k>` | Every 120 frames, roll back k frames and re-run them from unchanged inputs, comparing every snapshot region and checksum. The instrument that proves re-simulation is faithful. |
| `MELEE_NET_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES=<n>` | Disconnect (BYE) and exit at that frame, logging `net: test done at frame n`. |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_OOM_FRAME=<n>` | Fail the first snapshot taken at or after that frame, the way a failed allocation would, to exercise the lockstep fallback. |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_LOSS=<pct>` | Drop that share of outgoing packets. |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_DELAY_MS=<ms>` | Hold every outgoing packet that long. |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_DELAY_RX_MS=<ms>` | Hold every incoming packet that long (asymmetric links). |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_JITTER_MS=<ms>` | Uniform ±ms on the outgoing delay; reorders when larger than the delay. |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_REORDER=<pct>` | Hold that share of packets behind the next one. |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_DUP=<pct>` | Send that share of packets twice. |
| `MELEE_NET_SIM_BURST=<n>` | Every 5 s drop n consecutive outgoing packets. |

The link simulator's PRNG is seeded from `MELEE_NET_PORT`, so a run repeats.
Every 600 frames the log prints rollbacks, stalls, ping, jitter, loss and
snapshot cost; `net: DESYNC`, `net: cannot roll back` and `net: peer silent`
are the lines that mean something went wrong. Two copies on one machine also
need distinct `MELEE_CACHE_DIR` (pipeline cache) and `MELEE_KEY_FIFO` if you
drive them with key injection. Keyboard keys only reach the game while the
window has keyboard focus; `MELEE_KEY_FIFO` keys are deliberately exempt, so
harnesses can still drive menus in background windows.

A run that never leaves a menu proves nothing: outside a fight the state
checksum covers only the four pads and the RNG seed, so two title screens can
neither desync nor roll back. The harnesses below check that a match really
started before they report anything.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tools/net_test.py` | Two instances on this machine through a real match, asserting on both logs (both reach `net: test done`, exit 0, no DESYNC, no `peer silent`, no lost rollback). Direct mode boots straight into Link vs Mario via `MELEE_NET` + `MELEE_DEBUG_VS=1`; `--lan` walks the real menus into the LAN lobby and needs the shared LAN free; `--scenes` walks CSS and SSS too; `--oom FRAME` and `--disconnect` cover the snapshot-failure and hard-drop paths. |
| `tools/net_acceptance.py` | The same across a link matrix (loss, delay, jitter, reorder, dup, burst, asymmetric rx) into one markdown table. |
| `tools/net_lan_test.py` | Lobby paths a match never reaches: simultaneous Start, direct connect, a peer killed mid-lobby, the host killed while the guest connects. |
| `tools/net_determinism.py` | Records one run and replays it on every platform reachable from this machine, reporting the first frame that differs. Android and macOS report SKIPPED rather than passing. |
| `tools/net_fuzz.py`, `tools/net_lan_fuzz.py` | Malformed game datagrams and malformed mDNS records against a running instance. Both keep their crafted multicast on this host (`IP_MULTICAST_TTL 0`). |

```sh
python3 tools/net_test.py                                  # 2 min, clean link
python3 tools/net_test.py --loss 5 --delay 30 --jitter --reorder
python3 tools/net_test.py --lan --minutes 1
python3 tools/net_test.py --fuzz                           # tools/net_fuzz.py hammers A's port
python3 tools/net_determinism.py --only linux,linux-flip   # ~2 min, no Proton
```

`--exe build/melee`, `--disc ../melee.ciso`, `--port 42050` (B uses +1) and
`--work /tmp/net_test` (logs in `a.log`/`b.log`) are the defaults.
