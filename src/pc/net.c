/* Netplay prototype: two instances exchange one PADStatus per frame over UDP

 * a remote input that has not arrived yet is predicted as "repeat last", a
 * snapshot is taken before every predicted tick, and when the real input
 * turns out different the state is restored and the frames since re-run.
 * Both peers must boot with the same disc and no memory card; every session
 * agrees the rest -- seed, rules and unlock state -- in the match handshake,
 * the env path below included (net_handshake.c's handshake_direct). Sessions
 * can also be opened at runtime through pc_net_connect() (src/pc/net_lan.h).
 *
 *   MELEE_NET=host:port          peer address (enables netplay at boot)
 *   MELEE_NET_PORT=n             local UDP port (default 41000)
 *   MELEE_NET_PLAYER=0|1         which controller port the local player drives
 *   MELEE_NET_DELAY=n|auto       input delay in frames (default auto: from ping and jitter)
 *   MELEE_NET_RECONNECT_MS=ms    resume an interrupted session for this long (default 3000, 0 off)
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_LOSS=percent   drop that share of outgoing packets
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_DELAY_MS=ms    hold every outgoing packet that long
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_DELAY_RX_MS=ms hold every incoming packet that long (asymmetric links)
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_JITTER_MS=ms   uniform +-ms on the outgoing delay (reorders when > delay)
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_REORDER=pct    hold that share of packets behind the next one
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_DUP=pct        send that share of packets twice
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_BURST=n        every 5 s drop n consecutive outgoing packets
 *   (the simulator's PRNG is seeded from MELEE_NET_PORT, so runs repeat)
 *
 * This file is the session, the socket and the rollback loop; the wire
 * codec, link simulator, reliable channel, handshake, time sync and
 * snapshots are the net_*.c modules listed in net_internal.h. */

/* ---- receive -----------------------------------------------------------
 * Reception runs on a thread of its own (rx_main below), not on the game
 * thread. On the game thread a datagram waited in the socket until the frame
 * loop next drained it, so every freeze of that thread -- a load, a shader
 * compile, a phone descheduling it -- was measured as network latency by
 * both peers: the frozen side acked late, and timed the acks it received
 * late. Phone<->PC on one Wi-Fi network (~20 ms ping) logged ping max
 * 150-450 ms per window, matching the phone's frame freezes exactly, and
 * auto delay and the jitter mean (net_sync.c) consume that number. The
 * frozen side also stopped acking, so its peer counted its own packets as
 * lost and widened their redundancy.
 *
 * So the receive thread does the part that is about the link the moment a
 * datagram lands: drain the socket, authenticate, ack every input packet
 * and time every ack of ours. What is about the game goes through a queue
 * (rx_push) that recv_inputs applies on the game thread: the input rings,
 * s_remote_have, frame advantage, s_last_acked, the RTT statistics, the
 * reliable lanes and through them the handshake, resume, delay and scene
 * hand-off. A BYE or a protocol mismatch is a sticky flag instead, so a full
 * queue cannot lose it.
 *
 * Measured with tools/net_test.py --delay 10 --load-stall 0.3 (20 ms round
 * trip, one peer's game thread parked 300 ms): the other peer's ping max for
 * that window went from 339 ms to 27 ms, jitter from 7.1 to 0.9 ms. Its
 * steady ping went from 40-47 ms to 23-24 ms too, because the old figure also
 * carried most of a frame of drain delay on each end.
 *
 * The ack carries s_rx_have, the receive thread's contiguous mark over what
 * it has queued. on_inputs applies the same packets in the same order under
 * the same rule, so the next drain brings s_remote_have to that mark or past
 * it: an ack never claims a frame the game thread will not get, and the peer
 * drops a frame from its redundancy window (which starts at s_last_acked + 1)
 * only once it is queued here. A packet the full queue refuses is still
 * acked, with the unchanged mark, so the peer's RTT and loss stay honest.
 *
 * A thread rather than tx_timer: the timer polls every 4 ms, which would
 * put up to 4 ms of quantisation back into every sample on each side (the
 * error this removes, only smaller), and SDL runs every timer on one shared
 * thread. A thread parked in poll() wakes when the datagram lands. */

 * of game state is intact and both input rings still hold their last RING

 * socket, the 4 ms transmit timer and the 16 ms resends of the wait loop
 * stay exactly as they are, so the peer keeps being probed; on top of that
 * each side that opens a phase states what it holds in exactly one reliable

 * refill the gap through the ordinary input path (send_inputs' unacked
 * window, which always carries up to REDUNDANCY frames) and the wait ends
 * at the frame it was waiting for, the frames that were predicted before
 * the interruption being rolled back as usual.
 *
 * The rings bound what can be resumed and both sides' rings are frozen
 * during the phase: whoever is not parked can only run WINDOW + delay
 * frames past the other before it parks too, so one check at exchange time
 * cannot go stale.
 *
 * None of this runs in the common case and the frame loop grows no branch
 * for it: the phase is entered from the stall path, the refill rides on the

 * is about as long as a player waits before quitting anyway. Both were 7 s

 *
 * Two separate causes, both measured, both fixed:
 *
 * 1. The wall clock. gmtitle.c:161-170 stirred the RNG once per
 *    seconds-of-minute, so two machines that reached the title eight
 *    wall-seconds apart stirred 41 times against 49 (phone<->PC). Fixed at
 *    the source, because no repair here can invent the draws the other peer
 *    made.
 *
 * 2. Scene timing. The rest are scene-enter draws -- stage init, CPU AI init
 *    inside Fighter_Create -- backtraced across three 9900-frame sessions
 *    and never paced by rendering. Two peers of similar speed make them on
 *    the same frame, but a slow device does not: an SM-T505 against this PC
 *    drew at frame 232 where the PC drew later, and desynced there. The seed
 *    a tick starts from must therefore be the seed the last tick ended with,
 *    whatever the gap between them contained.
 *
 * Netplay only (`net.active`). A recording leg must NOT do this: whether a
 * draw falls inside or outside a tick depends on load timing, so rewriting
 * the seed makes a recording that only replays on a machine of the same
 * speed -- measured, it moved the replay divergence to frame 1. Netplay is
 * the opposite case: both peers run one frame stream and the repair is
 * applied identically on each, which is what makes them agree. */

 * re-run. The pair separates the two faults that both look like "the

 * inputs) breaks both, while a first pass that did something a re-run never
 * does -- rendered, loaded, ran a frame twice, read a clock -- breaks only
